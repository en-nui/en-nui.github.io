    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m a PhD Candidate in Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior with <a href="https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/newton-irene.html" target="_blank">Irene Newton</a> at Indiana University. As part of my training, I’m affiliated with the <a href="https://gems.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">NSF Institute for Genomics in Microbial Systems (GEMS)</a>.</p>

    <p>Before my PhD, I graduated from UMass Amherst in 2015 and returned back to my home in South Carolina. I drove tractors and conducted plant pathology experiments in a joint appointment with the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/" target="_blank">USDA-ARS</a> and <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/" target="_blank">Clemson University</a>. I also spent a few years cooking in a classic, French bistro.</p>

    <p>I then left the USDA to go conduct fieldwork in Chernobyl, Ukraine in order to explore the impact of radionuclide contamination on fungal biodiversity as a <a href="https://fulbright.org/" target="_blank">Fulbright Fellow</a>. During that time, I learned to leverage science as a tool of international diplomacy and community building.</p>

    <p>Now broke from a life in research (and a year of traveling), I leased my body and soul to a biotechnology startup, where I helped expand the company’s sequencing pipeline from 96 to >4,000 samples per week. I also developed assays that helped secure several crucial IP and patents.</p>

    <p>Much of my life’s joy is centered around three B’s: Biking, baking, and being (in my garden).</p>
